I'm a computer science engineer who advocates in self-taught education and continuous traineeship. This kind of personality led me to be in the research world of computer science. 
At the time of my educational stage in the Bachelor Degree in Computer Science at Universidad de La Laguna, I was especially into the fields:
• Artifical Intelligence
• Design of Algorithms
• Optimization
• Computational Complexity. 

After finishing my degree thesis called 'Challenge-driven algorithms development', I was drawn by all the possible applications of the meta-heuristics, highlighting the meta-heuristics which lie into the Evolutionary Computing field, to the resolution of the optimization problems.
 
These days I am working on my post-doctoral research on Machine Learning and Evolutionary Computing.
